about: >
  Hi, I’m <strong>Felipe Muñoz</strong> — cloud solutions architect and technology leader with
  <strong>12+ years of experience</strong> designing, migrating, and operating mission-critical platforms on
  <strong>Google Cloud</strong> for public and private sectors across Latin America.

  I’ve led <strong>large-scale infrastructure migrations</strong>, built <strong>data and AI platforms</strong>,
  and I’m currently building <strong>byCerebro</strong>, a SaaS platform for <strong>AI agent orchestration</strong>
  focused on automating real, high-impact business processes.

beliefs:
  - Cloud is not infrastructure — it’s <strong>execution capability</strong>
  - AI is not a model — it’s a <strong>living system</strong>
  - Architecture should serve the business, not the other way around
  - Automation is a <strong>competitive advantage</strong>, not a luxury

  - Secure, scalable <strong>cloud-native platforms</strong>
  - <strong>Production-grade AI systems</strong> (not demos)
  - <strong>Multi-agent</strong> and event-driven architectures
  - Infrastructure as Code ready for real-world operations
  - Solutions for <strong>government, banking, retail, and healthcare</strong>
